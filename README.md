Calendar GUI Application
This is a Python code example that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying a calendar. It allows the user to enter a year and generates a calendar for that year.

Dependencies
The code requires the following dependencies:

Tkinter: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
calendar: A module that provides various functions to manipulate calendars.
Make sure you have these libraries installed before running the code.

Usage
When you run the code, a window titled "Calendar" will appear.
Enter the desired year in the "Enter year" field.
Click the "Show Calendar" button to display the calendar for the entered year.
The calendar for the specified year will be displayed in a new window titled "Calendar for the Year".
To exit the program, you can click the "Exit" button.
Code Explanation
The code starts by importing the necessary modules, including Tkinter and calendar. Tkinter is used for creating the GUI, while the calendar module provides the function to generate the calendar for a given year.

The showCalendar() function is defined to handle the generation and display of the calendar. It retrieves the year entered by the user from the year_field Entry widget, creates a new Tkinter window (gui), and configures its appearance. The calendar for the specified year is obtained using calendar.calendar(year), and it is displayed in a Label widget (calYear) inside the gui window.

In the main part of the code, a new Tkinter window (new) is created to serve as the main interface. Various GUI elements, such as Labels, an Entry field, and Buttons, are defined and placed using the grid() method. The "Show Calendar" button is associated with the showCalendar() function, and the "Exit" button is linked to new.destroy to close the main window when clicked.

The program runs the main event loop using new.mainloop(), which keeps the GUI active and responsive to user interactions.# GUICalender
